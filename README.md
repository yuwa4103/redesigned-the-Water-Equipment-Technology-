# redesigned-the-Water-Equipment-Technology-
I redesigned the Water Equipment Technology for my final project. This sites is working for introduce the project which is company offer and the more specific detail for each project. Then the user can realize each project to get which one they really need to. The design of this sites is terrible before I redesigned. The usability is defective. The original sites kind of extra ppt slide you use to dump all the useless or under process information in. As for usability, the original sites not function well because the structure of the sites is chaotic and the layout is dazzling. Some parts are no functional. A lot of useless images and words on the original page. The overtly abused color scheme in every webpage you land, backed by the background images will only make you assume which one will fade and which one will fly in or float in or split or wipe. Then users stay unidentified with which is the most important part. Then effectiveness and efficiency are much low if the user try to find something. Before redesigned, the website doesnâ€™t have accessibility. The original website only functions on web browser and screen reader can not function well. This report introduces the evaluation of the Water Equipment Technology and the development of the website.
